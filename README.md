## Installing
Place `bgcustom.dll` from [Releases](https://github.com/IlEvelynIl/BGamer-Ultrawide-Fix/Releases) in the root of your game folder, make sure you have [BGamer v0.7](https://cabconmodding.com/threads/call-of-duty-black-ops-1-bgamer-t5-lan-offline-client-v0-7.6446/) or newer installed or this will not work.
